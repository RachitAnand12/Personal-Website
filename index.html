        <h2> Hi, I'm Rachit. I'm 10 years old. Something you NEED to knwo about me, is that I love being online. I love doing anything online, even if it is something I don't like. I do things such as watch youtube videos, see when my favorite soccer team is playing and more. I also like to play soccer but I don't like to consider it as a favorite though. I like Cricket better. My friends agree but some disagree. Anyways, I hope you like my personalities! </h2>
